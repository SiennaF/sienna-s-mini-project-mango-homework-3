<h2 style="color:lightblue"> Fun facts about MANGO!</h2>
<p><i>A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. It is believed to have originated in the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type". Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.</i></p>
<h2 style="color:lightgreen">History of Mango:</h2>
 The first attempt to introduce the mango into the U.S. came in 1833 to Florida. The species name of the mango is Mangiferi indica, which means “an Indian plant bearing mangos.” Mango bark, leaves, skin, flesh, and the pit have been used in folk remedies for centuries. What are mangos? Mangos are one of the most popular fruits in the world.
<h2 style="color:pink">Benefits of Mango:</h2>
<p><i>While many people understand the value of the mango fruit, borne on a tree scientifically known as Mangifera indica, few people recognize the value of the seed within it. In fact, it is often discarded and ignored, while it could be used for a variety of medicinal purposes. One of the largest single seeds in any fruit, this flat, creamy-white seed in the center of a mango possesses a dense supply of nutrients and antioxidants. Once these seeds are completely cleaned off and dried, they are then ground up into a powder. This can be made into various pastes and butter for topical use.</i></p>
<h2 style="color:lightblue">Types of Mangos:</h2>
<p><i>There’s a reason why mango is called the king of fruits! Its delicious and juicy taste is simply hard to beat! And there are over 1000 varieties, and each has a distinct flavor. This fruit has origins in India, but many cultivars are grown worldwide.</p></i>
<h2 style="color:pink">Importance of mangos:</h2>
<p><i>Mangos are a great source of fibre, a substance that’s essential for healthy digestion. 150g of the fruit contains almost 3g of fibre, which is equivalent to 10% of an adult’s recommended daily intake. 1 Mango additionally contains amylases, a type of digestive enzyme which helps the body break down big molecules of food so they can be more easily digested.</p></i>
<h2 style="color:lightgreen"></h2>
<p><i>I love being outside in the summer. To me, being in or near water helps to reduce feelings of stress—even just listening to the sound of water is soothing. Mango is a great way to enjoy fresh air, sunshine, and water all at the same time.</mark></b></u></i></p>
